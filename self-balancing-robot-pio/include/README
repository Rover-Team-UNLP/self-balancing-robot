# Include Directory

This directory is intended for project header files for the Self-Balancing Robot project.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include`.

Example usage:

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
#include "robot_config.h"
#include "sensors.h"
#include "motor_controller.h"

extern "C" void app_main(void)
{
    // Initialize robot components
    init_sensors();
    init_motors();
    // ...
}
```

## Recommended Header Files for Self-Balancing Robot:

- `robot_config.h` - Configuration constants and pin definitions
- `sensors.h` - IMU/gyroscope sensor interfaces
- `motor_controller.h` - Motor control functions
- `pid_controller.h` - PID algorithm implementation
- `balance_algorithm.h` - Self-balancing logic

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear
in only one place.
